Foreword

Chronological Chronicles is a Minecraft Alpha 1.1.2_01 mod, developed solely by me (ChimneyEggs). It's a difficult mod focused on expanding and encouraging exploration and combat. 

>>> NEW INSTRUCTIONS FOR 1.2+ VERSIONS<<<

Due to the introduction of the hub (and my laziness in implementing a proper system), Chronological Chronicles is now distributed as a zip file that contains two things:
    * The actual modded .jar
    * The Hub world

In order for everything to work properly, the .jar and the saved world need to be put into their correct places

- For BetaCraft users (recommended)

	1. Download the provided zip file
	2. Create a new alpha 1.1.2_01 instance, name it 'Chronological Chronicles'
	3. Launch the instance at least once (to set up everything according to your system and download resources)
	4. In the parent directory of the alpha 1.1.2_01, extract the zip file (this should automatically place the .jar into the versions directory, and the saves directory INTO the Chronological Chronicles directory
		a. If the zip file did not extract the files to their correct places, manually put them into their correct places
	5. Change the instance version from alpha 1.1.2_01 to the 'chronological_chronicles' .jar at the bottom of the Select Version list

- Prism Launcher	

	1. Download the provided zip file
	2. Create a new alpha 1.1.2_01 instance, name it 'Chronological Chronicles'
	3. Extract the zip file anywhere
	4. Take the .jar file and place it into the libraries directory of the instance (or graphically, pick 'Replace Minecraft.jar' in the edit window, and select the .jar
	5. Take the directory that contains the 'saves' directory, and copy the **contents** of it into the .Minecraft directory of the instance
